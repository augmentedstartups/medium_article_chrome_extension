# v1.7.0 - Full Automation

## Major Update: One-Button Complete Injection

### What Changed
The "Post to LinkedIn" button on Medium now does **everything** in one automated flow:

### Full Automation Flow

**On Medium:**
1. Click extension icon
2. Click "Extract"
3. Click "Post to LinkedIn"

**Automatic Process:**
1. ✅ Opens LinkedIn article editor
2. ✅ Inserts title
3. ✅ Uploads cover image
4. ✅ **Inserts body content** (text + images sequentially)
5. ✅ Uploads all article images with Next button clicks
6. ✅ Adds paragraph spacing
7. ✅ Verifies all images loaded

### No Manual Steps Required!

Previously required:
- Click "Post to LinkedIn"
- Wait for title/cover
- Click sidebar "Insert Article" button

Now:
- Click "Post to LinkedIn"
- **Done!** Everything happens automatically

### Technical Details

**Phase 1: Cover Image**
- Upload first image as thumbnail
- Click Next button
- Wait for modal to close

**Phase 2: Body Content**
- Use FILE_UPLOAD strategy
- Process blocks sequentially:
  - Text paragraphs (with spacing)
  - Headings (bold)
  - Images (upload + Next + modal close)
  - Lists
  - Blockquotes
  - Code blocks
- Each image takes ~3-5 seconds
- Total time depends on number of images

**Phase 3: Verification**
- Verify all images loaded
- Check content length
- Log final statistics

### Alternative Methods Still Available

1. **Sidebar Button** (top-right):
   - "✨ Insert Article" 
   - Manual trigger if needed
   - Shows article preview

2. **Test Button** (top-right):
   - "🧪 Insert Test Article"
   - For testing with fixed data

### Console Output

You'll see detailed logs:

- Cover image: ~3-5s

- Check console for specific error message

### Success Criteria
